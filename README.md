REACT
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications, by managing the view layer. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making the code easier to maintain and scale.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When a componentâ€™s state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first. It compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and only updates the parts that have changed, which improves performance.

State: State refers to data that is local to a component and can change over time. It helps React components maintain information that influences the output. When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new data. You typically define state using useState() in function components or this.state in class components. 

Event Handlers with React: React allows you to attach event handlers like onClick, onChange, onSubmit, etc., to elements, just like HTML, but with a camelCase naming convention.

Props/properties: are a way to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent to a child. They are read-only and cannot be changed by the receiving component.
